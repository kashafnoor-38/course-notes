## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on organizing code using objects and classes. It enhances code modularity, reusability, and maintainability by structuring programs around real-world entities.

## Core Concepts of OOP
 Class  – A blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).

Object – An instance of a class that contains specific data and can perform actions.

Encapsulation – Hiding internal details of an object and restricting direct access to some attributes for data security.

Inheritance – Allowing a class to derive properties and behaviors from another class, promoting reusability.

Polymorphism – Enabling a single interface to be used for different data types or classes, making code more flexible.

Abstraction – Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionality to the user.

## Benefits of OOP
✔ Code Reusability – Reduces redundancy by using classes and objects multiple times.
<br>
✔ Modularity – Organizes code into separate entities, making it easy to manage.
<br>
✔ Scalability – Supports easy modification and extension of code.
<br>
✔ Security – Protects sensitive data using encapsulation.

OOP is widely used in languages like Java, Python, C++, and C# for building scalable and efficient applications.
